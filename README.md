# My Mac Setup
For some time now I've been wanting to share my setup with other engineers - discovering tools other people use could feel like actually finding a hidden treasure.
This is work in progress, and I will try to update when I discover new tools.

## Productivity
### Alfred (Launcher) - [site](https://www.alfredapp.com/)
Can be used for easily launching apps and finding files using a keyboard shortcut.  
Paid version supports more complex flows.  
This is one of the first tools I install on a new Mac!

### Station (Unified workstation tool) - [site](https://getstation.com/)
This app can host all of your common webapps in one place.  
Instead of pinning tabs in Chrome, you can setup apps like Gmail, Google calendar, WhatsApp web, Telegram to be always available under your station.  
They support most of the commonly used apps out there, and can sync your profile across machines.

### 1Password (Password management) - [site](https://1password.com/)
The best password manager on the planet. Worth every penny.

### Todoist (GTD) - [site](https://todoist.com/)
I believe I have tried as many GTD (Get Things Done) apps as the number of years I've been alive, including trying to create one by myself, back in my WPF days (say what???). None of these app has survived on my app list more than Todoist. Its' simplicity, ease of adding a new task with a due date and support for ALL different platforms, has helped me reach tasking bliss.

## Coding
### Atom (text editor++) - [site](https://atom.io/)
Different jobs have different IDE requirements, and I usually prefer to use a [JetBrains](http://jetbrains.com/) IDE for coding, but I always need my Atom ready and handy for simpler tasks / web development.

I also make sure to link atom in the bin folder, so I can open a folder/file in atom from the terminal `atom FOLDER_NAME`:

```bash
sudo ln -s /Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/atom.sh /usr/local/bin/atom
```
