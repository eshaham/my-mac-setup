# My Mac Setup
For some time now I've been wanting to share my setup with other engineers - discovering tools other people use could feel like actually finding a hidden treasure.
This is work in progress, and I will try to update when I discover new tools.

## Productivity
### Alfred (Launcher) - [site](https://www.alfredapp.com/)

Can be used for easily launching apps and finding files using a keyboard shortcut.  
Paid version supports more complex flows.  
This is one of the first tools I install on a new Mac!
